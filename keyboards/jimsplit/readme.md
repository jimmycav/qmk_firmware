# jimsplit

A handwired Ferris Sweep clone.

STLs are provided - to print the right hand side, mirror the plate and case before slicing.

It's designed to support various sockets, so the plate has holes in it that can be used for sockets that support different switches. For the first build it uses Outemu low profile switches and therefore a handwired hotswap socket because I couldn't find hotswap sockets that fit. An MX socket is also provided, but not tested.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make jimsplit:default

Flashing example for this keyboard:

    make jimsplit:default:flash
